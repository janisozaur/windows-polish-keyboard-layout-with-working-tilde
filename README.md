This repository contains keyboard layout with modified "Polish (programmers)" to contain working tilde

Microsoft in its infinite wisdom decided to make the tilde key on the Polish keyboard layout useless.

This repository contains a modified version of the Polish (programmers) keyboard layout that removes "dead key" functionality from the tilde key, making it suitable for development.

## Installation

Download the msi installer and dll, run the installer.

## Usage

After installing, go to Settings -> Time and Language -> Language and region -> <click ellipsis on your desired language> -> Language options -> Add keyboard -> "Polish (programmers) - tilde"

## Contributing

I do not expect anyone to contribute to this repository. Feel free to fork it and make your own changes.

To build, you will need MSKLC 1.4: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=102134

Source file for the layout is included, but you can easily recreate it by loading the "Polish (programmers)" keyboard, selecting "Shift state", selecting the tilde key, then removing "Dead key?" from the properties.
